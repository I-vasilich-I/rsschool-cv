    <h1>Oleg Vaskevich</h1>
    <h2>Contacts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>e-mail</li>
        <li>telegram</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>The goal is to get to stage 2 for now, after that - we'll see. I'm not sure about the job as a front-end
        developer yet. I need to study the subject to know for sure if it's my thing. Though I want to get some
        international skill/profession for more flexibility in life, and the computer-related job is my thing. I'm
        working now as "1C Programmer"/Sysadmin - yeah, yeah, I know it's hardly THE programming, but still, it's good
        enough for Belarus, Ukraine, Russia for now. Anyway, I can't imagine myself in my, let's say, 40-50s still doing
        this job. I want something else.
    </p>
    <p>I like to solve problems, search for ways to fix them, etc. Come to think of it, it might be that testing is my
        thing.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <h5>Programming Languages:</h5>
    <li>basic knowledge on C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP, etc.</li>
    <h5>Google Search ðŸ˜†</h5>

    <h2>Code examples</h2>
    <p>I'll put some code from codewars.com to show that I can add it to my .md file. I don't have any code to show off
        yet ðŸ˜†</p>
    <li>let greet = () => "hello world!";</li>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <li>I'm an educated IT engineer. University: BSTU</li>
    <p>I received basic knowledge on some variations of languages like C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP, etc.
        there, nothing serious though, kind of codewars stage#1. Basic knowledge of OOP too.
    </p>
    <p>Also familiar with HTML, CSS, XML, can't say that I mastered it, but with Google, everything is possible.</p>

    <h2>English</h2>
    <P>Somewhere in between of intermediate-upper-intermediate-advanced level. I've got basic English from school and
        the University, but 10 years ago I began to watch all kinds of stuff in English: YouTube, Movies, TV-Shows. Used
        some learning apps, I'd say I studied passively, for fun, not that I needed it for something.
    </P>
    <p>I still watch everything mostly in English, also do read books in English. BTW last month I've read The Modern
        JavaScript Tutorial in English too.</p>

    <p>The last 3 years spent practicing speaking skills with native speakers, mostly Americans, through voice messages.
        This year spent a lot of time on Discord voice calls talking to native speakers.</p>
    <p>I have 3 problems in English now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>grammar rules/spelling</li>
        <li>lack of speaking vocabulary</li>
        <li>speaking itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <P>I do believe they will be solved by itself with practice. I have a strong desire to put myself in the English
        environment, programming might be one of the ways to do that.</P>

    <h2>Polish</h2>
    <p>Beginner level. Can read, and understand at least half of it, maybe more. Currently reading out loud the book
        series "The Witcher". Reading out loud is a good way to get used to any language. Sometimes I make posts
        containing audio of me reading in polish on HelloTalk, so I always get feedback from native speakers on my
        pronunciation.
    </p>

    <h2>Chinese(Mandarin)</h2>

    <p>Beginner level. Can say a few basic phrases, can read pinyin (transliteration of hieroglyphs/characters), can
        read a few characters as well. Actively studying on the course yoyo chinese. As with polish, I make a lot of
        posts on HelloTalk in Chinese too.
    </p>
    <p>There are 2 apps that I use for studying all 3 languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HelloTalk</li>
        <li>AnkiDroid</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also listening to the radio and watching YouTube in the target language helps a lot.</p>
