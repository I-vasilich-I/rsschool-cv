            </header>
            <p>The goal is to get to stage 2 for now, after that - we'll see. I'm not sure about the job as a front-end
                developer yet. I need to study the subject to know for sure if it's my thing. Though I want to get some
                international skill/profession for more flexibility in life, and the computer-related job is my thing.
                I'm
                working now as "1C Programmer"/Sysadmin - yeah, yeah, I know it's hardly THE programming, but still,
                it's
                good
                enough for Belarus, Ukraine, Russia for now. Anyway, I can't imagine myself in my, let's say, 40-50s
                still
                doing
                this job. I want something else.
            </p>
            <p>I like to solve problems, search for ways to fix them, etc. Come to think of it, it might be that testing
                is
                my
                thing.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I received basic knowledge on some variations of languages like C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP,
                etc.
                there, nothing serious though, kind of <a

            </p>
            <p>Also familiar with HTML, CSS, XML, can't say that I mastered it, but with <a

                <h2>English</h2>
            </header>
            <P>Somewhere in between of intermediate-upper-intermediate-advanced level. I've got basic English from
                school
                and
                the University, but 10 years ago I began to watch all kinds of stuff in English: YouTube, Movies,
                TV-Shows.
                Used
                some learning apps, I'd say I studied passively, for fun, not that I needed it for something.</P>
            <p>I still watch everything mostly in English, also do read books in English. BTW last month I've read
                <a href="https://javascript.info/" target="_blank">The Modern JavaScript Tutorial</a> in English too.
            </p>

            <p>The last 3 years spent practicing speaking skills with native speakers, mostly Americans, through voice
                messages.
                This year spent a lot of time on <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> voice calls
                talking to native speakers.</p>
            <p>I have 3 problems in English now:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>grammar rules/spelling</li>
                <li>lack of speaking vocabulary</li>
                <li>speaking itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <P>I do believe they will be solved by itself with practice. I have a strong desire to put myself in the
                English
                environment, programming might be one of the ways to do that.</P>

                <h2>Polish</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Beginner level. Can read, and understand at least half of it, maybe more. Currently reading out loud the
                book
                series "The Witcher". Reading out loud is a good way to get used to any language. Sometimes I make posts
                containing audio of me reading in polish on <a href="https://www.hellotalk.com/"
                    target="_blank">HelloTalk</a>, so I always get feedback from native speakers on my
                pronunciation.

            <p>Beginner level. Can say a few basic phrases, can read pinyin (transliteration of hieroglyphs/characters),
                can
                read a few characters as well. Actively studying on the course <a href="https://www.yoyochinese.com"
                    target="_blank">yoyo chinese</a>. As with polish, I make a lot of
                posts on <a href="https://www.hellotalk.com/" target="_blank">HelloTalk</a> in Chinese too.
