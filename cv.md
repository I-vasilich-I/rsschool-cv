## **Summary**
The goal is to get to stage 2 for now, after that - we'll see. I'm not sure about the job as a front-end developer yet. I need to study the subject to know for sure if it's my thing. Though I want to get some international skill/profession for more flexibility in life, and the computer-related job is my thing. I'm working now as "1C Programmer"/Sysadmin - yeah, yeah, I know it's hardly THE programming, but still, it's good enough for Belarus, Ukraine, Russia for now. Anyway, I can't imagine myself in my, let's say, 40-50s still doing this job. I want something else. 

I like to solve problems, search for ways to fix them, etc. Come to think of it, it might be that testing is my thing. 


## **Skills**
#### **Programming Languages:** 
basic knowledge on C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP, etc.
#### [**Google Search**](https://www.google.com/) ðŸ˜†

## **Code examples**

I'll put some code from [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) to show that I can add it to my .md file. I don't have any code to show off yet ðŸ˜† 
```javascript
let greet = () => "hello world!";
```

## **Education**
- I'm an educated IT engineer. University: [**BSTU**](https://www.bstu.by/)

I received basic knowledge on some variations of languages like C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP, etc. there, nothing serious though, kind of [codewars stage#1](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/codewars-stage-1.md#codewars-stage-1). Basic knowledge of OOP too.

Also familiar with HTML, CSS, XML, can't say that I mastered it, but with [Google](https://www.google.com/), everything is possible.
