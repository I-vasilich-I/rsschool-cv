- I'm an educated IT engineer. University: [**BSTU**](https://www.bstu.by/)
I received basic knowledge on some variations of languages like C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP, etc. there, nothing serious though, kind of [codewars stage#1](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/codewars-stage-1.md#codewars-stage-1). Basic knowledge of OOP too.

## **English**
Upper-intermediate-advanced level.
Listening, Reading - Advanced+ level;
Speaking, Writing - intermediate level;

I watch everything mostly in English, also do read books in English. Mostly everything that I've learned so far was from sources in English. 

The last 3 years spent practicing speaking skills with native speakers, mostly Americans, through voice messages. This year spent a lot of time on [Discord](https://discord.com/) voice calls talking to native speakers. 
 
I have a strong desire to put myself in the English environment, programming might be the one of the ways to do that.
