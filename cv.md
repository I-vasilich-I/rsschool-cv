## **Summary**
The goal is to get to stage 2 for now, after that - we'll see. Little bit of an update: I've got to the stage 2, didn't get mentor yet though, but I might get one. Anyway, I like it so far. I want to get better, cause I know that I know not that much yet)) But I've practiced a lot of stuff for last 2 months. And let's go back to my previous speech)) I'm working now as "1C Programmer"/Sysadmin - yeah, yeah, I know it's hardly THE programming, but still, it's good enough for Belarus, Ukraine, Russia for now. Anyway, I can't imagine myself in my, let's say, 40-50s still doing this job. I want something else. 

I like to solve problems, search for ways to fix them, etc. 


## **Skills**
#### **Programming Languages:** 
basic knowledge on C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP, etc.
#### [**Google Search**](https://www.google.com/) ðŸ˜†

## **Code examples**

I'll put some code from [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) to show that I can add it to my .md file. I don't have any code to show off yet ðŸ˜† 
```javascript
let greet = () => "hello world!";
```

## **Education**
- I'm an educated IT engineer. University: [**BSTU**](https://www.bstu.by/)

I received basic knowledge on some variations of languages like C, C++, Delphi, Java, JavaSrcript, PHP, etc. there, nothing serious though, kind of [codewars stage#1](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/codewars-stage-1.md#codewars-stage-1). Basic knowledge of OOP too.

Also familiar with HTML, CSS, XML, can't say that I mastered it, but with [Google](https://www.google.com/), everything is possible.


## **English**
Somewhere in between of intermediate-upper-intermediate-advanced level. 
I've got basic English from school and the University, but 10 years ago I began to watch all kinds of stuff in English: YouTube, Movies, TV-Shows. Used some learning apps, I'd say I studied passively, for fun, not that I needed it for something. 

I still watch everything mostly in English, also do read books in English. BTW last month  I've read [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) in English too. 

The last 3 years spent practicing speaking skills with native speakers, mostly Americans, through voice messages. This year spent a lot of time on [Discord](https://discord.com/) voice calls talking to native speakers. 

I have 3 problems in English now: 
- grammar rules/spelling 
- lack of speaking vocabulary
- speaking itself. 
 
I do believe they will be solved by itself with practice. 
I have a strong desire to put myself in the English environment, programming might be one of the ways to do that.


## **Polish**
Beginner level. Can read, and understand at least half of it, maybe more. Currently reading out loud the book series "The Witcher". Reading out loud is a good way to get used to any language. Sometimes I make posts containing audio of me reading in polish on [HelloTalk](https://www.hellotalk.com/), so I always get feedback from native speakers on my pronunciation.


## **Chinese(Mandarin)**
Beginner level. Can say a few basic phrases, can read pinyin (transliteration of hieroglyphs/characters), can read a few characters as well. Actively studying(that thing is on a pause for 2 months) on the course [yoyo chinese](https://www.yoyochinese.com). As with polish, I make a lot of posts on [HelloTalk](https://www.hellotalk.com/) in Chinese too.

*There are 2 apps that I use for studying all 3 languages:*
- [HelloTalk](https://www.hellotalk.com/)
- [AnkiDroid](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) 

*Also listening to the [radio](https://tunein.com/) and watching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) in the target language helps a lot.*
