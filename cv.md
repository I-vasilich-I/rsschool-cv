## **Summary**
The goal is to get to stage 2 for now, after that - we'll see. I'm not sure about the job as a front-end developer yet. I need to study the subject to know for sure if it's my thing. Though I want to get some international skill/profession for more flexibility in life, and the computer-related job is my thing. I'm working now as "1C Programmer"/Sysadmin - yeah, yeah, I know it's hardly THE programming, but still, it's good enough for Belarus, Ukraine, Russia for now. Anyway, I can't imagine myself in my, let's say, 40-50s still doing this job. I want something else. 

I like to solve problems, search for ways to fix them, etc. Come to think of it, it might be that testing is my thing.
